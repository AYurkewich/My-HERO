Description: pygatt - Python Module for Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Profile (GATT).
        =========================================================================
        
        This Module allows reading and writing to GATT descriptors on devices
        such as fitness trackers, sensors, and anything implementing standard
        GATT Descriptor behavior.
        
        pygatt provides a Pythonic API by wrapping two different backends:
        
        -  BlueZ (requires Linux), using the ``gatttool`` command-line utility.
        -  Bluegiga's BGAPI, compatible with USB adapters like the BLED112.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Despite the popularity of BLE, we have yet to find a good programming
        interface for it on desktop computers. Since most peripherals are
        designed to work with smartphones, this space is neglected. One
        interactive interface, BlueZ's ``gatttool``, is functional but difficult
        to use programmatically. BlueZ itself obviously works, but the interface
        leaves something to be desired and only works in Linux.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 2.7.5 or greater, or Python 3.5 or greater
        
           -  Python 2.7.3's ``struct`` library has a bug that will break PyGATT - 2.7.5
                 or greater is recommended.
        
        -  BlueZ 5.18 or greater (with gatttool) - required for the gatttool
           backend only.
        
           -  Tested on 5.18, 5.21, 5.35 and 5.43
        
        -  GATTToolBackend requires Linux (i.e. not Windows compatible)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install ``pygatt`` with pip from PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pygatt
        
        The BlueZ backend is not supported by default as it requires
        ``pexpect``, which can only be installed in a UNIX-based environment. If
        you wish to use that backend, install the optional dependencies with:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install "pygatt[GATTTOOL]"
        
        Install the latest development version of ``pygatt`` with pip:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install git+https://github.com/peplin/pygatt
        
        Documentation
        ----------
        
        The documentation for pygatt consists of:
        
        - This README
        - The code in the ``samples`` directory
        - The Python docstrings in the code itself.
        
        The ``BLEDevice`` and ``BLEBackend`` base classes are the primary interfaces for
        users of the library.
        
        Example Use
        -----------
        
        The primary API for users of this library is provided by
        ``pygatt.BLEBackend`` and ``pygatt.BLEDevice``. After initializing an
        instance of the preferred backend (available implementations are found
        in ``pygatt.backends``, use the ``BLEBackend.connect`` method to connect
        to a device and get an instance of ``BLEDevice.``
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pygatt
        
            # The BGAPI backend will attempt to auto-discover the serial device name of the
            # attached BGAPI-compatible USB adapter.
            adapter = pygatt.BGAPIBackend()
        
            try:
                adapter.start()
                device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')
                value = device.char_read("a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b")
            finally:
                adapter.stop()
        
        Note that not all backends support connecting to more than 1 device at
        at time, so calling ``BLEBackend.connect`` again may terminate existing
        connections.
        
        Here's the same example using the GATTTool backend. It's identical
        except for the initialization of the backend:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pygatt
        
            adapter = pygatt.GATTToolBackend()
        
            try:
                adapter.start()
                device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')
                value = device.char_read("a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b")
            finally:
                adapter.stop()
        
        Notifications Example
        ---------------------
        
        This example uses the gatttool backend to connect to a device with a specific
        MAC address, subscribes for notifications on a characteristic, and prints the
        data returned in each notification.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import pygatt
            from binascii import hexlify
        
            adapter = pygatt.GATTToolBackend()
        
            def handle_data(handle, value):
                """
                handle -- integer, characteristic read handle the data was received on
                value -- bytearray, the data returned in the notification
                """
                print("Received data: %s" % hexlify(value))
        
            try:
                adapter.start()
                device = adapter.connect('01:23:45:67:89:ab')
        
                device.subscribe("a1e8f5b1-696b-4e4c-87c6-69dfe0b0093b",
                                 callback=handle_data)
            finally:
                adapter.stop()
        
        Debugging
        ---------
        
        While debugging software using pygatt, it is often useful to see what's
        happening inside the library. You can enable debugging logging and have
        it printed to your terminal with this code:
        
        ::
        
            import pygatt
            import logging
        
            logging.basicConfig()
            logging.getLogger('pygatt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        
        Can't find BGAPI device in Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You may need to explicitly specify the COM port of your BGAPI-compatible
        device in windows, e.g.:
        
        ::
        
            adapter = pygatt.BGAPIBackend(serial_port='COM9')
        
        If you provide the COM port name, but still get an error such as
        ``WindowsError(2, 'The system cannot find the file specified.')``, try
        changing the COM port of the device to a value under 10, e.g. ``COM9``.

        Releasing to PyPI
        -----------------
        
        For the maintainers of the project, when you want to make a release:
        
        -  Merge all of the changes into ``master``.
        -  Update the version in ``setup.py``.
        -  Update the ``CHANGELOG.mkd``
        -  Tag the commit and push to GitHub (will need to push to a separate
           branch of PR first since ``master`` is a protected branch).
        -  Travis CI will take care of the rest - it will build and deploy
           tagged commits to PyPI automatically.

           in a bad state.
        -  Improvement: Allow custom timeout for discovery on GATTTool backend.
        -  Fix: Make sure responses to char reads on BGAPI backend are from the

        V3.0.0
        ------

           ``address_type`` argument as the GATTTool backend [BGAPI].
        -  [API Change] The ``address_type`` argument on both backends now
           requires a value from a new enum, ``pygatt.BLEAddressType``, instead
           of a string.
        -  Made Python 3 support a priority for both GATTTOOL and BGAPI
           backends.
        -  Improve reliability of BGAPI backend by re-setting device for each
           connection.

        -  Feature: Allow unsubscribing from notifications.
        -  Improvement: Allow more time to discover characteristics. [GATTTOOL]
        -  Improvement: Allow using gatttol backend without root. [GATTTOOL]
        -  Improvement: Standardize type of UUID so comparison always works (str
           vs unicode)
        -  Fix: Fix packaging so the version on PyPI can be installed.
        -  Fix: Fix Python 3 compatibility.
